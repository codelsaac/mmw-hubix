## Authentication
This project uses NextAuth.js with **username-based** authentication (not email). Default behavior: Users are logged out by default; there is no auto-login.

### Default Demo Accounts
| Role | Username | Password | Access Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Admin** | `admin` | `admin123` | Full admin console access |
| **Helper** | `helper` | `helper123` | IT dashboard access |
| **Student** | `guest` | `guest123` | Read-only access to training and resources |

**Features:**
- ✅ Role-based access control (ADMIN, HELPER, STUDENT)
- ✅ Protected routes with server-side auth
- ✅ Session management with NextAuth.js

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a **`.env`** file in your project root for local development:

```env
# ================================
# MMW Hubix - Local Development
# ================================

# Database (MySQL) - Required
# Format: mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?connection_limit=5
# Example: password with @ must be encoded as %40
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@localhost:3306/mmw_hubix_dev?connection_limit=5"

# NextAuth.js - Required
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="dev-secret-change-in-production"

# Application URLs - Optional
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# AI Chat (OpenRouter) - Optional
# Get API key from: https://openrouter.ai/
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

**🔑 Environment Variables Explained:**

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ Yes | MySQL connection string |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | ✅ Yes | Base URL for authentication callbacks |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | ✅ Yes | Secret for encrypting session tokens |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | ⚠️ Optional | Public-facing app URL (defaults to NEXTAUTH_URL) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | ⚠️ Optional | API key for AI chat feature |
| `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` | ⚠️ Optional | Override OpenRouter endpoint if needed |
| `OPENROUTER_MODEL` | ⚠️ Optional | Select model (defaults to `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`) |

### AI Chat Rate Limits (429)

- The AI chat uses OpenRouter. Free upstream models can return `429` when rate-limited.
- The `/api/chat` route now handles `429` gracefully:
  - Performs limited retries with backoff and, if still limited, returns `429` with a helpful message.
  - Clients should surface a “Please retry shortly” notice to users.
- To reduce `429` errors:
  - Add your own `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to `.env` (https://openrouter.ai/settings/integrations).
  - Consider selecting a less rate-limited model via `OPENROUTER_MODEL`.
  - Avoid rapid consecutive requests; the app also enforces server-side rate limiting.

**📁 Environment Files:**
```
.env             # Local development and default configuration
.env.production  # Production deployment
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Use different database names for development and production  
> - Development: `mmw_hubix_dev`

- Long text fields use appropriate MySQL types:
  - description, textContent → @db.Text or @db.LongText
- Max lengths for URLs/image paths:
  - image, url, videoUrl, fileUrl → @db.VarChar(2048)
  - fileName → @db.VarChar(255)
- JSON string fields:
  - permissions, attendees → @db.Text
- Other notes:
  - Keep primary key id as cuid() for cross-database compatibility
  - Remove composite unique keys if unnecessary
  - Align FK delete strategies with Prisma definitions (e.g., NextAuth relations onDelete: Cascade)

### Verification
- Start the local server and check data completeness for each module (resources, events, tasks, training resources, etc.)
- Verify create/update/delete actions via the admin pages

### Site Config
Edit config/site.ts to customize site basics:
```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  name: "MMW Hubix",
  description: "School Information Portal for C.C.C. Mong Man Wai College",
  url: "https://mmw-hubix.vercel.app",
  // ... other settings
}
```

## 📝 Development Guide

### Add a New Page
1. Create a new folder under app/
2. Add a page.tsx file
3. Follow the App Router conventions

### Create a New Component
1. Add a file under components/
2. Use TypeScript and React
3. Follow naming conventions

### Making Database Changes

**Before Making Changes:**
1. Stop all Node processes to avoid file locks:
   ```powershell
   taskkill /F /IM node.exe
   ```

**Workflow:**
1. Edit schema file: `prisma/schema.prisma`

2. Choose your approach:
   
   **Option A: Development (Quick)** - Use `db push` for rapid iteration
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate      # Regenerate Prisma Client
   npx prisma db push       # Push changes to database
   npm run db:seed          # Re-seed if needed
   ```
   
   **Option B: Production (Migrations)** - Use migrations for version control
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate           # Regenerate Prisma Client
   npx prisma migrate dev        # Create migration file
   # Prisma will prompt for migration name
   npm run db:seed               # Re-seed if needed
   ```

3. Update related code:
   - API routes that use the modified models
   - Components that display the data
   - TypeScript types if needed

4. **Run mandatory quality checks:**
   ```bash
   npm run quality-check
   ```

5. Test your changes:
   ```bash
   npm run dev              # Start dev server
   npx prisma studio        # Verify data in database
   ```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "EPERM: operation not permitted"
**Cause:** Node processes are locking Prisma client files  
**Solution:**
```powershell
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
npx prisma generate
```

#### Issue: "Error validating datasource: the URL must start with mysql://"
**Cause:** DATABASE_URL not configured correctly  
**Solution:**
- Check `.env` has correct DATABASE_URL
- For SQLite: `DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"`
- For MySQL: `DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@localhost:3306/mmw_hubix_dev"`

#### Issue: "Can't reach database server"
**Cause:** MySQL server not running  
**Solution:**
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Start MySQL service
3. Verify port 3306 is not blocked

#### Issue: Development server not starting
**Cause:** Port 3000 already in use  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Find process using port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual process ID)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

#### Issue: Database schema out of sync
**Cause:** Schema changes not applied  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# For MySQL
npx prisma db push
```

## 🪟 Windows Production Setup

Running a production build locally on Windows for testing or internal deployment.

### Quick Setup

1. **Configure Environment:**
   ```powershell
   # Create .env.production in project root
   # Add these variables (replace with your values):
   DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/mmw_hubix_prod?connection_limit=10"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<generate-with: openssl rand -base64 32>"
   ```

2. **Prepare Database:**
   ```powershell
   # Create production database
   mysql -u root -p
   CREATE DATABASE mmw_hubix_prod CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   exit;
   
   # Run migrations
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   npm run db:seed
   ```

3. **Build and Run:**
   ```powershell
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

### Alternative: PowerShell Environment Variables

Set variables for current session (temporary):
```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL = "mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/mmw_hubix_prod"
$env:NEXTAUTH_URL = "http://localhost:3000"
$env:NEXTAUTH_SECRET = "your-secret-key"
npm start
```

Set variables permanently (persists across sessions):
```powershell
setx DATABASE_URL "mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/mmw_hubix_prod"
setx NEXTAUTH_URL "http://localhost:3000"
setx NEXTAUTH_SECRET "your-secret-key"
# Close and reopen PowerShell, then:
npm start
```

> ⚠️ **Security Note:** URL-encode special characters in passwords  
> Example: `p@ssw0rd!` → `p%40ssw0rd%21`

### Troubleshooting

**Build Fails:**
```powershell
# Clear Next.js cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
npm run build
```

**Database Connection Error:**
```powershell
# Verify MySQL is running
netstat -ano | findstr :3306

# Test connection
mysql -u root -p
```

**Port 3000 In Use:**
```powershell
# Find process using port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill process (replace PID)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```
