#### Test TC001
- **Test Name:** Username-based Login Success
- **Test Code:** [TC001_Username_based_Login_Success.py](./TC001_Username_based_Login_Success.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/32db8e16-ac01-4958-b7fe-14bdf5fd66fb/9658c86b-e90b-4896-8002-b206a2db5417
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** The username-based login functionality works correctly. Users can successfully authenticate using valid credentials and are properly redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on their assigned role. This core authentication flow is functioning as designed.

---

#### Test TC002
- **Test Name:** Username-based Login Failure with Incorrect Credentials
- **Test Code:** [TC002_Username_based_Login_Failure_with_Incorrect_Credentials.py](./TC002_Username_based_Login_Failure_with_Incorrect_Credentials.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/32db8e16-ac01-4958-b7fe-14bdf5fd66fb/80b5c22f-437c-4c35-8447-8a2d0bdf6105
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** Error handling for failed login attempts works properly. The system correctly rejects invalid credentials and displays appropriate error messages without allowing unauthorized access. This security measure is functioning correctly.

---

#### Test TC003
- **Test Name:** Session Persistence After Login
- **Test Code:** [TC003_Session_Persistence_After_Login.py](./TC003_Session_Persistence_After_Login.py)
- **Test Error:** Test completed. User session persists after login and page reload. However, access to other protected routes like 'Admin Panel' failed as clicking the link did not navigate away from the Dashboard. This indicates a potential issue with route access or navigation after login. Please investigate this issue further.
Browser Console Logs:
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized) (at http://localhost:3000/api/admin/settings:0:0)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/32db8e16-ac01-4958-b7fe-14bdf5fd66fb/8169a43a-bce4-420c-ae7f-9955a9cf6830
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Analysis / Findings:** **CRITICAL ISSUE**: While session persistence after page reload works correctly, there is a significant routing problem. Users cannot navigate to protected admin routes after login. The `/api/admin/settings` endpoint returns 401 Unauthorized errors even for authenticated users. This suggests either:
  1. Session cookies are not being properly sent with API requests
  2. The auth middleware is not correctly validating session tokens
  3. There's a CORS or cookie configuration issue preventing proper authentication on certain routes
  
  **Recommendation:** Investigate the auth middleware in `lib/auth-server.ts` and verify NextAuth session handling for API routes. Check cookie configuration in `auth.ts`.

---

#### Test TC007
- **Test Name:** Resource Click Tracking
- **Test Code:** [TC007_Resource_Click_Tracking.py](./TC007_Resource_Click_Tracking.py)
- **Test Error:** The public Resource Hub page is currently under maintenance and inaccessible. This prevents performing the required click on resource links and verifying if clicks are tracked and recorded accurately. Testing cannot proceed further until the Resource Hub is available. Please resolve the maintenance issue and retry the test.
Browser Console Logs:
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized) (at http://localhost:3000/api/admin/settings:0:0)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/32db8e16-ac01-4958-b7fe-14bdf5fd66fb/a65661ba-ee3d-49da-b775-cedd42881d50
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Analysis / Findings:** **ISSUE**: The test encountered a maintenance page or access issue when trying to test click tracking. This is inconsistent with TC006 which showed the Resource Hub was accessible. The 401 error on `/api/admin/settings` suggests there may be an issue with the maintenance page component trying to fetch admin settings even for public users.

  **Recommendation:** Review the maintenance page logic and ensure it doesn't make unauthorized API calls. Verify that click tracking analytics can be tested independently of the maintenance state.
